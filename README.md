# RSpec Intro
Together, we will write a car racing app in a test driven way! We have the following requirements:

- Use a `Car` class
- `Car` should have the attribute `speed` which should be readable and writeable
- A car should be able to accelerate and decelarate by a custom number
- Max speed is 200
- Min speed is 0
- A car race will return a random car out of all car instances

Check out the solution branch for the solution.
